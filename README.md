Description: developing my programming skills by creating a project in collaboration with Doctors, who feel certain processes could be streamlined.

FYI: I just started this project on June 14th, 2022. If you're looking for more details on other work I have done. I would navigate to my build-week-scaffolding-project, where I built an app that allows you to create a user account, and add plant cards to track all the plants you have and when to water them. I built both the client-side and backend api in one folder so you can navigate to both ends in one main folder. I understand on large scale applications you would never do that, but since it was such small application I decided to go that route.
